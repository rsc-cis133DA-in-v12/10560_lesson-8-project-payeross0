# Lesson 8 Project
For this project, the computer company client is asking you to remove the internal CSS and use external CSS so that colors can be easily edited by the company in the future. Theyâ€™ve provided a template as a starting point for making a new page that they'd like to have included on their website, an About page. You will be making the About page in this lesson according to the directions provided below.

Make sure you save and test your web page frequently throughout this lesson, including syncing it to GitHub and applying Commits. Make sure that all elements within the web page are working and displaying correctly by using the **Preview** pane in VS Code.

## Project Prep 
1. If you haven't done so already, clone the repo to your computer within your course folder.
2. Open the repo within VS Code. You can open this `readme.md` file within VS Code to view the project directions there. 

   > **TIP:** Right click on the file and choose the `Open Preview` option.
3. If there are files and folders present other than this `readme.md` file, take some time to familiarize yourself with the files within the repo so you know where they are located. This will help you when asked to use them within the project directions.

   > **TIP:** Before beginning any work on the project, read through all the steps to understand what you will be doing.

***
**IMPORTANT: Be sure to Save and Sync your work to GitHub regularly, applying appropriate Commit comments as you go.**

You will also need to move your internal styles so that they can be edited externally. To do this within the Explorer Pane in VS Studio Code, complete the following:

1. Create a subfolder within your Lesson 8 course folder called: **css**
0. Create an external stylesheet in the css subfolder called: **default_style.css**
0. Open the **template.html** file and do the following:
    - Appropriately link the external style sheet you created in the previous step.
    - Move all of the internal styles to the external stylesheet.

      > **TIP:** Go to [**Lesson 7, External Stylesheets**](https://riosalado.coursearc.com/content/cis133da-in-v12/lesson-7-enhancing-the-look-of-web-pages-using-css/internal-and-external-style-sheets#External-Style-Sheets) to review how to add an external stylesheet.
    - Remove any remaining HTML for the internal stylesheet.
    - Preview the template.html page and make sure that all styles being applied as expected. You will need to modify the link to the background-image for the header element since your styles are now in an external stylesheet. ***Hint: the link to the image is relative to the stylesheet, not the template.html file. See the information on [Relative Links](https://riosalado.coursearc.com/content/cis133da-in-v12/lesson-6-links-lists-and-images/links#Relative-Links) from Lesson 6.***
    - Save your changes. Sync your changes and apply a commit.

## Create the About Page

1. Save a copy of the template file to your Lesson 8 Repo folder as: **about.html**
2. In the HEAD section, update the **multi-line comment** to add your section number and the lesson number.
3. Within the HEAD section, update the **metadata** with the following:
    1. Change the title to: **About Us**
    2. Define the author using your first and last name.
    3. Add a minimum of **5 keywords** appropriate for the page content.
    4. Add an appropriate **description**.
4. Within the BODY section, create a content **division** element that starts right after the opening body tag and ends before the closing body tag. **TIP:** Essentially all content that currently exists in the body should be a child element of this new division element.
    1. Apply an id to the division element called: **wrapper**
    2. This will only be used once in your code, therefore use an appropriate unique identity.
5. Within the navigation bar, do the following:
    1. Apply a class to the "About" link element called: **active**.
    2. Change the link text for the third link to `Book an Appointment`. Apply a class to this menu item called: **right**. Be sure to apply the class to the list item, not just the link.
6. Within the main section, create an **aside** element.
7. Within the aside element, do the following:
    1. Display the image of the city of Phoenix provided to you in the repo. Set the width of the image to 150px. (You will be modifying this later, but for now, this will allow you to view the image on your page.)
    2. Create a caption for the image that displays: <code>Source: [Joe Cook](https://unsplash.com/@joecook)</code>
        - Include a working link to the source provided and apply an appropriate text-level semantic tag for the caption.
            > **Link to Source:** <code>https://unsplash.com/photos/qcofFqnGjww</code>
8. Below the aside element, and still within the main section, do the following:
    1. Create an **article** element to contain the second-level heading and paragraph of placeholder text.
    2. Change the second-level heading to display: **Welcome to Computer Systems Incorporated**
    3. Remove the placeholder text and replace it with the following three paragraphs:

9. Within the footer, add your MEID to the copyright and update the year, if necessary.
10. Your About page should look similar to the following image at this point in the project.

## Style the About Page

1. If necessary, open the external stylesheet.
0. Add a multi-lined comment that displays:
    > <code>Author:<br>Course:<br>Lesson:</code>
    - Insert your MEID as the author, your course name (CIS133DA) and section number for the course, and add the current lesson number.
0. In the Header Styles, confirm that the background image displays. If needed, adjust the URL to be relative to the location of the stylesheet - not the web page.
0. In the Navigation Bar styles, add an appropriate style to style the active class you created in this project. The style should:
    - Add a background color using your desired color method.
    - Add a font color, if needed, to coordinate with the new background color.
    > **TIP:** This style should make it so that the page the user is actively on is highlighted.
0. In the Navigation Bar styles, add an appropriate style to style the right class you created in this project. The style should:
    - Add a background color using your desired color method.
    - Add a font color, if needed, to coordinate with the new background color.
    - Float the element to the right.
0. In the Navigation Bar styles, add an appropriate style to adjust the size and position of the navigation menu bar: 
    - Fix the navigation bar to the top of the page.
    - Change the width to 100%.
    > **TIP:** Notice how the navigation bar overlaps some of the header image at the top of the page. Learn how to fix this in the next step.
0. In the Body styles, add an appropriate style to style the wrapper you created in this lesson to:
    - Add a light gray background color using your desired color method.
    - Add a top margin of 50px. 
    > **TIP:** Now you should notice that the navigation has less overlapping of the header content. This is because of the margin you added, which moves your entire wrapper down 50px.
0. Within the main styles, style the main section to:
    - Define the width of the element to 900px.
    - Utilize an appropriate box-sizing value to automatically subtract any padding applied to the element.
    - Center the element on the page. **HINT:** The text alignment should not be affected, and remain at default (left).
0. Within the main styles, style the aside section to:
    - Apply a medium gray background color using your desired color method.
    - Define the width of the element to 30% of the container.
    - Utilize an appropriate box-sizing value to automatically subtract any padding applied to the element.
    - Add 10px of padding to all sides.
    - Adjust the margin on all sides to 10px.
    - Float the element to the right.
0. Style the images within the aside section to:
    - Fill the full width of the container. **HINT:** Use a width value that will fill the parent element.
    - Define the height to 200px.
    - Adjust the size of the image so that the image will clip to fit to the size of the container.
     - Change the transparency of the image to 60% opacity.
0. Style the hover state of the images to:
    - Change the transparency of the image to 100% opacity.
0. Style the paragraphs within the aside section to:
    - Remove the margin on all sides.
    - Set the text color to gray using your desired color method.
0. Style the links within the aside section to:
    - Set the text color using your desired color method.
0. For the body style, add a margin of 0.
0. Save your changes. 
0. If necessary, open the Template and About page. Compare how the changes you made to the styles appear for both pages.
